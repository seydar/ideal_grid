# Pitch Questions
# If you could hire someone else, what would they do?
I would hire someone to build a UI. While my UI works for now, I will need to
build a better UI in order to answer other questions more quickly in the future;
someone who has experience with Javascript would be much faster at building a
functional interface than I would be.

# What do you plan to do with the money? How will it be spent?
You are paying for my consultation and for me to build out the infrastructure to
answer the questions under analysis.

One of the major benefits of this is approach is that asking the same question
multiple times (with different parameters) becomes significantly reduced in
time, particularly because of the automated nature of the computer model.
