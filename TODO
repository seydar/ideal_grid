TODO
-----------------------------
* move filter_kruskal.rb into graph.rb
* also integrate k_means_pp.rb et al into graph.rb
* make edge/node more specific to line/load
* **ADD PARALLELIZATION SERIALIZATION METHOD TO EASE PARALLELIZATION**

* How do we add edges between nodes?
  * How do we do it smartly?
* How do we decide whether to enlarge a generator or build a new one?
  * there is currently no method to this madness

* Physarum polycephalum is the bacteria that can develop optimal transportation networks
* RandiÄ‡ index could be useful?
  * https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0972860017301408

DONE
----------------------------
* Fix k_means where it doesn't converge sometimes
* edges need to have transmission loss. there needs to be a penalty for longer transmission lines

BUGGY RUNS
