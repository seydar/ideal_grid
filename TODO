TODO
-----------------------------
* move filter_kruskal.rb into graph.rb
* also integrate k_means_pp.rb et al into graph.rb
* make edge/node more specific to line/load
* **ADD PARALLELIZATION SERIALIZATION METHOD TO EASE PARALLELIZATION**
* Fix k_means where it doesn't converge sometimes
* For Generator#reach:
  - need to identify traffic through edges
  - from image 496 to 497, there is a TON of switching.
    - weird. wrong. shouldn't happen.
