TODO
-----------------------------
* move filter_kruskal.rb into graph.rb
* also integrate k_means_pp.rb et al into graph.rb
* make edge/node more specific to line/load
* **ADD PARALLELIZATION SERIALIZATION METHOD TO EASE PARALLELIZATION**
* Fix k_means where it doesn't converge sometimes

* How do we add edges between nodes?
  * How do we do it smartly?
