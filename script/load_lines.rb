# How the fuck do I build a table piece-wise of all the transmission
# lines in the country? I save the points based on a simplification
# algorithm that's dependent on whatever set I'm looking at, so the
# junctures that join different areas could get fucked up.
#
# Ugh. Maybe I ultimately have to run the data on the entire country at
# once. Not fun.
#
# Maybe a lil bit of parallelization in the `join_points` method would make
# this palatable.
